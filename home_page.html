<h2 class="entry-title">Hi, This is Li Cao and welcome to my web site</h2>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>I am a self-motivated research associate in data science, working on machine learning and deep learning applications</p>



<p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">Some stories</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<p> I always believe that hard working along with smart intellgence is the key factor to get success in the life and happiness and honesty are more of life pursuits than all other things such as money, reputation, etc. I value friendship and believe that with mutual respect and being generous, loyal, honest and humorous can lead to long-term friendships. </p>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">My hobbies</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<p> As a very beginner in cooking, I particularly love chinese cuisine, and have accumulated lots of recipe sources from Youtube. I am alwasy willing to cook for my friends althought some of my friends would love to have dinner outside with me after they tasted my dishes.</p>

<p> I play the piano in my free time. I have been playing the piano since I was 4 years old and it now becomes my hobby for daily recreation. Some AI teams are trying to apply AI techniques to create music pieces and even to create digital singers, but I believe that humans' creativity and emotional expression can never be replaced by machine learning agents.</p>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">How I use my personal website</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<p> I am a curious person who has strong interest to learn new things, so I will use this website to share my learning process in Machine Learning with you, and also I may share new hobbies, new skills that I obtain in my daily life. I will try to make my website prettier and well organized, if you see no update, it means either I am tired (want to do nothing after work) or I am typing new contents and pushing it to git page.</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p> If you are curious about what kind of projects I have done so far, please click my name, Li Cao, on the top, it will direct you to my index page.</p>
