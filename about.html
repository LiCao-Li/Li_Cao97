<p>Hi welcome to my web site</p>

<p>Hi welcome to Li's personal web site</p >

<p>Presently, I am a data scientist at a dynamic startup, where my primary focus revolves around alternative credit scores for risk assessment/management and build models to improve loan default risks with imbalance dataset, particularly for subprime groups in both the USA and Canada. While I can't disclose all the details, I can assure you that our endeavors in this field are both exciting and hold great promise for advancing credit scoring methodologies.
<p>Before that, I was a research assistant in machine learning at Argonne National Laboraty, I developed my expertise in the filed of reinforcement learning, digital twins, computer vision and reinforcement learnings, through developing algorithms, building predictive models on supercomputers, fine tunning hyper-parameters, conducting cross validations and successfully delivering predictive outcomes for clients use. </p >

<p>I received my master science degree from The University of Chicago, concentrated in machine learning. </p>

<p>Before I stepped into data science field, I majored in actuarial science in University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). I followed the SOA track, concentrated on life insurance. I have a very solid background in statistics, and passed P-exam and FM exam.</p>

<p>You'll find here discussions of my projects and my resume. If you have questions, feel free to contact me via <a href="mailto:licao@uchicago.edu">licao@uchicago.edu</a>
