<h2 class="entry-title">Hi, This is Li Cao and welcome to my web site</h2>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>I am a data scientist working on machine learning and deep learning applications</p>



<p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">Some stories</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<p> I always believe that hard working along with smart intellgence is the key factor to get success in the life and happiness and honesty are more of life pursuits than all other things such as money, reputation, etc. I value friendship and believe that with mutual respect and being generous, loyal, honest and humorous can lead to long-term friendships. </p>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">My hobbies</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<p> As a very beginner in cooking, I particularly love chinese cuisine, and have accumulated lots of recipe sources from Youtube. I am alwasy willing to cook for my friends althought some of my friends would love to have dinner outside with me after they tasted my dishes.</p>

<p> I play the piano in my free time. I have been playing the piano since I was 4 years old and it now becomes my hobby for daily recreation. Some AI teams are trying to apply AI techniques to create music pieces and even to create digital singers, but I believe that humans' creativity and emotional expression can never be replaced by machine learning agents.</p>
</ul>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">Research Projects</span></strong></p>

  <li>and reinforcement learning agent for optimizations</li>
</ul>
</ul>
 
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">Academic Data Science Projects</span></strong></p>
