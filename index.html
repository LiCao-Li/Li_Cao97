<h2 class="entry-title">Hi, This is Li Cao and welcome to my web site</h2>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>I am a data scientist working on machine learning and deep learning applications</p>



<p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">Some stories</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<p> I always believe that hard working along with smart intellgence is the key factor to get success in the life and happiness and honesty are more of life pursuits than all other things such as money, reputation, etc. I value friendship and believe that with mutual respect and being generous, loyal, honest and humorous can lead to long-term friendships. </p>
</ul>

<!-- <p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">My hobbies</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<p> As a very beginner in cooking, I particularly love chinese cuisine, and have accumulated lots of recipe sources from Youtube. I am alwasy willing to cook for my friends althought some of my friends would love to have dinner outside with me after they tasted my dishes.</p>

<p> I play the piano in my free time. I have been playing the piano since I was 4 years old and it now becomes my hobby for daily recreation. Some AI teams are trying to apply AI techniques to create music pieces and even to create digital singers, but I believe that humans' creativity and emotional expression can never be replaced by machine learning agents.</p>
</ul> -->

<p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">Research Projects</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000">Reinforcement Learning</span></strong>applications on material science domains, including: </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><span style="color: #000000">Digital Twins:</span></strong> translate math formulas in coating theory into python language, in order to accelerate model training process with domain knowledge involved</li>
  <li><strong><span style="color: #000000">Neural Network Models</span></strong> for image classifications: apply transfer learning and auto-encoder methods to identify defects in coating images. Cross validation method largely improved the prediction accuracy in my case. </li>
  <li><strong><span style="color: #000000">reinforcement learning</span></strong> with customized environment based on problem descriptions: build reinforcement learning algorithms(DDPG for continuous actions) to find the stable regions during coating process </li>
  <li>Main tools I used in this project include Linux, Python, Tensorflow</li>
</ul>
</ul>
 
<p style="margin-bottom: 1px"><strong><span style="color: #162f4d;font-size: 13pt">Academic Data Science Projects</span></strong></p>
